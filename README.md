+	In this project using only an Arduino with an Ethernet shield.
+	I'll be controlling one servo, but you can apply this method to control a DC motors, buzzers, relays, stepper motors, etc..
+	
+	Overview:
+	When you upload the the code provided in this tutorials. it creates a webserver in your LAN and you simply use the IP to access that webserver through your browser. After that it shows a webpage similar to that one below. When you press the button "Feed Cats" your url will change to: http://192.168.1.100/?button1on the arduino will read that information and It turns the servo On.
+	
+	By default the IP is 192.168.1.100. that also can be found on the Arduino code provided.
+	
+	Parts Required
+	1x Arduino Uno
+	1x Ethernet Shield 
+	1x Micro Servo Motor

+	Justin.tv is a free online service for broadcasting live audio/video streams. After creating an account, I can publish my live webcam feed by clicking the 'Go Live!' button in the top-right corner of the page. I allow access to my webcam when asked and click the 'Start' button to begin broadcasting. Once my channel is live, I can embed the output in a webpage using some simple HTML code
+	using http://www.justin.tv/widgets/live_embed_player.swf?channel=YOURCHANNELNAME and you can add a feed cam on your webcam.
